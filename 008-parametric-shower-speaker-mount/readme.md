# Parametric shower speaker mount

## Overview

A handy hanging system for hanging a waterproof bluetooth speaker in the shower. Fully customizable, though pre-configured for Anker Soundcore 2.

## Instructions

Print using PETG or other mostly hydrophobic material for best results. Thicker shells means it will last longer and yield against temperature changes. PETG also lends itself better against the temperature range that a shower pipe will have due to it's higher glass transition temperature.

Print `Shower Mount` once, and `Speaker Mount Bracket` twice

### Parametric

The provided files are preconfigured for the Anker Soundcore 2, but it can be configured to fit any waterproof speaker with a rectangular shape.

Here's some of the more notable parameters you can change, though there are lots!

- `shower_diam` - The diameter of the shower head (in mm)
- `speaker_cover_distance` - The distance between both hooks
- `speaker_height` - The speaker body height (mm)
- `speaker_depth` - The speaker body depth (mm)

## Lore

Not much lore besides wanting a shower speaker. It's a great entry point to show off the utility of 3d printing to the uninitiated.
