# Wall Mount Holder

![1](./images/1.png)

## Overview

Simply load bearing wall mount for things that require looped hooks. Adjustable size via FreeCAD.

## Instructions

Print in any filament, but PLA seems to be best for this specific model. Each part can be printed in an assembly.

### Parametric

The default hook can be modified to enable some additional sizes.

- `hook_width` - The width of the internal hook area (mm)
- `hook_length` - The length of the internal hook area (mm)
- `padding` - The thickness of every wall (mm)

## Lore

My mother made a gift for me that required me to have a load bearing mount that allowed loops. This was the end result of that.
