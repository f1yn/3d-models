# Fridge Repair Bracket

## Overview

Fixes a problem I experienced with my fridge shelf drawer not being connected to the shelf.

Specifically designed for Frigidaire (FRT18G4AWM) 

## Printing Instructions

100% Infill is recommended for best results

.2mm or .3mm layer height

## Lore

Why replace the entire fridge drawer when you can print a 5-10 cent piece of PLA instead?
