# Flynn's model monorepo

## Description

This is my repository for my public CAD projects and their associated exports. All of these projects are prototyped
using a 3d printer.

Each directory represents a _mostly_ or _fully_ complete project, each with:

* **A readme file**, containing the project overview, fabrication requirements (mostly slicer settings), and assembly instructions.
* **One or more 3d model files** (`.stl`), that represents a different part of a project's assembly.
* **Picture(s) demonstrating the intended final result** after fabricating the entire assembly.
* **A FreeCAD file*** (`.FCStd`). This can be used for making modifications to different parametric settings to adjust spacings,
  paddings, and other measurements.
    * \* (just a note that not all projects will have this)
