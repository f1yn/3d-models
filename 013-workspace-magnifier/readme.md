# Workspace Magnifier (deprecated)

> This model is very niche and wont fit use cases outside of the very specific parts it was built around.

## Overview

A workspace magnification helper build from the disposed parts of a invalid projector. Let's me (micro) solder without having to hover directly over pieces as I work on them.

## Instructions

To be printed with the flat faces on the build plate. PLA is suitable for this piece, and thicker walls are ideal for bearing the weight of the projection lenses.

## Lore

I bought a really really cheap projector off of Amazon sometime in early 2022. It was awful, and ended up becoming a liability after the internal pieces of said projector started melting. I received a full refund, but was left with a projector that had no intention of seeing another day.

Within the projector itself were a few Fresnel lenses, and a couple of other useful parts that could be reused within other projects.
