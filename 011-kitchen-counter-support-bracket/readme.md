# Kitchen Counter Support Bracket

## Overview

Does your dish-rack extend your counter? This load bearing design can hold 20 lbs of weight.

## Instruction

This model is designed to be printed with the load bearing faces on the plate. use thicker walls, though the majority of the load will be transferred into the counter itself - PLA can yield if not printed with this in mind.

The support bracket (which inserts into the main mount) needs to be printed twice.

### Parametric

This specific model is unique in the sense that, it's not usable unless you specifically measure the counter this will be installed on. There's many parameters in the FreeCAD file, but I've included the most important ones below:

- `thickness` - Wall thickness (mm)
- `counter_height` - The height of the counter itself - measure this exactly (mm)
- `rack_bracket_depth` - How far the mount will extend from the counter (mm)
- `support_bracket_counter_depth` - How far the support bracket will extend into the counter (mm)

## Lore

A bad (rental) kitchen layout meant I had barely any room for a dish-rack. Without a dishwasher (same problem) this meant that I needed to prioritize a design that would work with the kitchen. This model was also an experiment in (shearing) load bearing designs.
